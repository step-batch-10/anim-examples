# Animation Examples

This repository contains various examples of animations that you can then check out with [Loop The Loop](https://step.github.io/loop-the-loop)

## Usage

If you just want to see the output 

```sh
deno 01_static.js 
```


If you want to use the output in `Loop The Loop`

```sh
deno 01_static.js > static.txt
```

I recommend creating a directory called "animations" and storing all the outputs there instead.

Most of the examples output in a way that can be consumed by `Loop The Loop` . Some examples are primarily for the terminal and are mentioned as such in the comments of that example.

The examples are written in a way that you can understand and also reuse to make your own. They are also numbered for your convenience. Start at `01_static.js` and work your way upward.

Enjoy!
